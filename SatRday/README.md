# SatRday Conference Presentation
## Chicago, IL - April 27, 2019
 
## Abstract:

Leveraging Databases in R

In the age of big data, data scientists should leverage relational databases in their workflow. Doing so, analysts can integrate the power of a database engine for munging and calculating; the ease and expressiveness of SQL; robust framework for efficiently stored and secured data with referential integrity and normalization; and streamlined i/o workflow for data summarization, visualization, modeling, and high end computing. With R’s well-maintained and executed DBI standard including generalized (odbc, jdbc) and specific APIs (RPostgreSQL, RMySQL, RSQLite, ROracle, and others), today’s R users have limitless opportunities for database solutions. This talk shows examples of such a workflow with R data analysis projects that connects to a diversity of small and large proprietary and open-source relational databases including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and IBM’s DB2 with examples of data sourcing, aggregation, modeling, and graphing solutions. Use cases include large transportation data: Chicago’s CTA bus/rail ridership, Divvy bike trips, and Metra’s on-time performance data.
