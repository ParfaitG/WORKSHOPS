## PostgreSQL As a Data Science Database

With today's volume, velocity, and variety of big data and challenges of reproducibility, data scientists can leverage a powerful relational database such as PostgreSQL in their analytical projects by way of R. Using this approach, teams no longer have to navigate and manage disorganized flat files and file folders but can now centralize their process in a durable, secure, and centralized platform for data persistence, integrity, and a powerful engine with expressive SQL dialect to compile, join, and aggregate data. With well-developed DB-APIs including ODBC/JDBC, R can now seamlessly develop robust data analytics solutions while connecting to a powerful backend system. This talk walks through a use case example of an environment database comprised of data from various sources (Department of Energy, NOAA, USGS, NASA, Federal Reserve, World Bank, and others) and encompassing various domains (climatology, biology, energy, economics, engineering, oceanography, and demography) to furnish summary tables and data visualization outputs that features a docker container; multiple DB-API connections; text file import; metadata storage; and complex join and aggregate SQL queries.
